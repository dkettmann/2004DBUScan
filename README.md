Historical Archive of Perl scripts written in 2004 - DialBackupScan

I wrote these scripts in aprox 2003-2004 for a previous employer.

From what I remember, this script would cycle through all ~2000 sites and ask them via SNMP if they had any Async interfaces up. It would
then chuck any which replied in the affirmative onto a list.  When done it would ask the rptr script to update the webpage that we on the
team would monitor.
